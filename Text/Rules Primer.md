# Rules Primer

# Description
Do Gods Err Too is a board game about teaming up with allies to fight singularly powerful opponents. Each player controls a character who participates in the fight as they accululate, shape, and expend elements. 

# How to play
 - Set up the map, monster, and characters as directed by the scenerio.
 - Nominate one player as primary. Certain effects begin with the primary and cycle to the left.
 - Go through the steps of a round.
 - Repeat rounds until all character are destroyed (loss), no scourge are available in that deck or discard (loss), the monster is destroyed (win), or the scenerio objectives are achieved (win)

 ## Round Structure
 1. Kindling
     - Deal one scourge from it's deck to the behavior pile and one to each character. If a character still has a scourge, move the existing scourge to the shared attack area at the same time.
     - Resolve conditions and other effects with a Kindling trigger.
 2. Nurture
     - Characters choose how to allocate their resources. Place Input resources on the Locus abilities the character wishes to activate.
     - Characters may cut. Gain 1 threat and 1 basic resource.
3. Strive
     - Simultaneously, all abilities with correct inputs activate. Discard the inputs back to the central collection.
     - Collect the correct outputs and put them on the activated ability. 
     - Characters use movement in turn order, starting with primary. 
4. Disrupt
     - Characters may allocate resources to distract or discard their own scourge or to discard any scourge in the shared attacks.
     - A character may pay for some or all of the costs for a scourge in the shared area.
     - Distract attacks will not trigger this round at all.
5. Suffer 
     - Move the monster according to the top scourge in the behavior pile. Any character the moster moves past suffers the attack showing on that card.
     - Each character suffers the attack from their assigned scourge unless it was distracted or discarded.
     - All characters suffer the attacs from the shared attacks that were not discarded. 
     - Each entity (mostly characters and monsters) removes their toughness value from their current threat, and moves the remaining threat to damage. 
     - Clear all elements from scourge and pass the primary character token to the left.
