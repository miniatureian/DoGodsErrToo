# Overview
Before history, a terribly violent world existed. One man achieved enlightenment and took all that energy into himself. His goal was to allow the world to flourish. That energy sustained, empowered, and corrupted him for millenia. 

Eventually, he just exploded. Nowadays, only experts at manipulating elemental energies succeed at fighting. All the sophisticated ranged weapons were ineffective, because a large part of fighting is intention, and melee weapons deliver intention more powerfully.
